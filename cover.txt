Cover Letter

I believe people are born to create. From the very childhood subconsciously I was trying to create something 
and express myself through different sphere: singing at high schools, 9 years of music school, 
7 years of martial arts, but surprisingly the sphere of art, that fits me best, was close to my uni major of computer science - front end and web development. I donâ€™t care that it might not be mature or serious enough for 
a developer with C++/Java knowledge. I love this world. I want to make it better, and create.
